Her estranged sister, Dorothy, suddenly arrives one winter day with her business associate, Charlie Blanchard. Though Dorothy inherited half the dairy with her sister when their father died, she lives in New York City and has no interest in the farm, other than to realize what cash it can produce. Though Dorothy claims the sale would preserve the business as a dairy, it turns out an offer by Richardson Development is more lucrative. Their plan would be to raze the 50-year-old family dairy farm to create 50 house lots. Emily and her mother want to preserve her father's legacy but they need to find $400,000 by Christmas Eve to buy out the sister Dorothy.
